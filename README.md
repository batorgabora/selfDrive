you can save or delete best performing car and let the mutations make it better (or worse) - the rate of mutation can be changed <br>
you can adjust the input neurons and the number of neurons in the hidden layer, which resets best saved car <br>
the number of lanes and traffic can be adjusted <br>
and also the number of self-driving cars <br>
<br>
after any changes just refresh the website to start again <br>
<br>
and the fun part: using wasd keyboard inputs you can race the best car
