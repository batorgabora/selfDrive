# selfDrive

I made this JavaScript and HTML project while following <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY&si=HxeXSpk8B4t9GKn_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial</a>, 
                    later expanding it through trial, error, and research. <br>
                    The simulation uses a simple neural network to train self-driving cars that improve through mutation â€” you can adjust the mutation rate, number of neurons, lanes, and traffic density. 
                    These core mechanics, along with the raycasting and segment-intersection logic for car sensors, were implemented entirely by me. <br><br>
                    Each change resets the best-performing car, which can also be saved or deleted manually. <br>
                    And for fun, you can even drive the best car yourself using WASD controls.
